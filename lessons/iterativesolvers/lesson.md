Before running the examples, you must switch to the bash shell by using

```

```

## Example 1: Structural Mechanics Beam Deflection:

This code uses MFEM and [PETSc/TAO](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) to demonstrate the convergence of Krylov methods.

The source code is included in [ex2p.c](./ex2p.c)

Notes: Normally PETSc options can be passed as command line arguments. But because MFEM turns off this capability, PETSc options must be passed either in a file or in the PETSC_OPTIONS environmental variable. See the file rc_ex2p for the PETSc options that are supplied to the application in these examples.

### Run 1: Run with Jacobi preconditioner

```
PETSC_OPTIONS="-pc_type jacobi -ksp_max_it 25" ./ex2p -petscopts rc_ex2p --mesh /projects/ATPESC2017/NumericalPackages/handson/mfem/data/beam-tri.mesh
```

The first column of the output is the residual norm. The next two are the maximum and minimum estimated eigenvalues of the operator and the final column is the condition number.

#### Questions
> **Is the iteration converging?**

> **Read the output at the bottom from -ksp_view ... What Krylov method and preconditioner are being used?**

### Run 2: Run with the algebraic multigrid preconditioner

```
./ex2p -petscopts rc_ex2p --mesh /projects/ATPESC2017/NumericalPackages/handson/mfem/data/beam-tri.mesh
```

#### Questions
> **Is the iteration now converging?**

> **Read the output at the bottom from -ksp_view ... What Krylov method and preconditioner are being used?**

### Run 3: Run with the algebraic multigrid preconditioner but no conjugate gradient method

```
PETSC_OPTIONS="-ksp_norm_type preconditioned -ksp_type richardson -ksp_max_it 25"  ./ex2p -petscopts rc_ex2p --mesh /projects/ATPESC2017/NumericalPackages/handson/mfem/data/beam-tri.mesh
```

#### Questions
> **Is the iteration now converging?**

### Run 4: Run with the algebraic multigrid preconditioner but with GMRES and a restart of 10

```
PETSC_OPTIONS="-ksp_norm_type preconditioned -ksp_type gmres -ksp_gmres_restart 10"  ./ex2p -petscopts rc_ex2p --mesh /projects/ATPESC2017/NumericalPackages/handson/mfem/data/beam-tri.mesh
```

Now run with a gmres restart of 30

```
PETSC_OPTIONS="-ksp_norm_type preconditioned -ksp_type gmres -ksp_gmres_restart 30"  ./ex2p -petscopts rc_ex2p --mesh /projects/ATPESC2017/NumericalPackages/handson/mfem/data/beam-tri.mesh
```

Note the convergence is now very similar to that with CG.

Now attempt to run this in parallel and obtain solver performance data
```
PETSC_OPTIONS="-log_view -ksp_norm_type preconditioned -ksp_type gmres -ksp_gmres_restart 30" ${MPIEXEC_OMPI} -n 4 ./ex2p -petscopts rc_ex2p --mesh /projects/ATPESC2017/NumericalPackages/handson/mfem/data/beam-tri.mesh
```

## Example 2: Nonlinear Problem:

```
PETSC_OPTS="-snes_rtol 1.e-10 -snes_view  -pc_type bjacobi -sub_pc_type ilu " ./ex10p -m ../../data/beam-quad.mesh --petscopts rc_ex10p -s 3 -rs 2 -dt 3 | more
```

Note the quadratic convergence; the residual norm exponent doubles until it runs out of digits to double.

## Out-Brief

We have used [PETSc](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) to demonstrate the use of preconditioned Krylov methods. Many examples are available for various aspects of PETSc functionality, including
* [Krylov solver examples](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-current/src/ksp/ksp/examples/tutorials)
* [Nonlinear solver examples](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-current/src/snes/examples/tutorials)
