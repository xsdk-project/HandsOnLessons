## Example 1: Generator Stability Analysis:

This code uses [PETSc/TAO](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) to demonstrates how to solve an ODE-constrained optimization problem with the Toolkit for Advanced Optimization (TAO), TSEvent, TSAdjoint and TS.
The objective is to maximize the mechanical power input subject to the generator swing equations and a constraint on the maximum rotor angle deviation, which is reformulated as a minimization problem

![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbegin%7Balign%2A%7D%0D%0A%20%20%5Cmin%20%26%20%5C%7B-P_m%20%2B%20%5Csigma%5Cdisplaystyle%20%5Cint_%7Bt_0%7D%5E%7Bt_F%7D%20%5Cmax%5Cleft%280%2C%20%5Ctheta%20-%20%5Ctheta_%7Bmax%7D%5Cright%29%5E%5Ceta%20%5C%20%5Cmathrm%7Bd%7Dt%20%5C%7D%5C%5C%0D%0A%20%20%5Cnonumber%20%7E%7E%20%5Ctext%7Bs.t.%7D%20%26%20%5Cqquad%20%5Cfrac%7Bd%20%5Ctheta%7D%7Bdt%7D%20%3D%20%5Comega_B%5Cleft%28%5Comega%20-%20%5Comega_s%5Cright%29%20%5C%5C%0D%0A%20%20%26%20%5Cqquad%20%5Cfrac%7Bd%20%5Comega%7D%7Bdt%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Comega_s%7D%7B2H%7D%5Cleft%28P_m%20-%20P_%7Bmax%7D%5Csin%28%5Ctheta%29%20-%20D%28%5Comega%20-%20%5Comega_s%29%5Cright%29%0D%0A%5Cend%7Balign%2A%7D)

Disturbance (a fault) is applied to the generator at time 0.1 and cleared at time 0.2.
The objective function contains an integral function.
The gradient is computed with the discrete adjoint of an implicit time stepping method ([Crank-Nicolson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crank–Nicolson_method)).

### Compile the code
During ATPESC, participants do not need to compile code because binaries are available in the ATPESC project folder on Cooley. In case you are using your own copy of PETSc, this example is located in `src/ts/examples/power_grid/`. To compile, run the following in the source folder
```
make ex3opt
```
The source code is included in [ex3opt.c](./ex3opt.c)

All the example codes need to compiled only once. Different tasks can be accomplished using command line options.

### Command line options
You can determine the command line options available for this particular example by doing
```
./ex3opt -help
```
and show the options related to TAO only by doing
```
./ex3opt -help | grep tao
```

A more complicated example for power grid application is in `src/ts/examples/power_grid/stability_9bus/ex9busopt.c`.


## Example 2: Hybrid Dynamical System:

This code demonstrates how to compute the adjoint sensitivity for a complex dynamical system involving discontinuities with TSEvent, TSAdjoint and TS. The dynamics are described by the ODE

![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cdot%7Bx%7D%20%3D%20A_i%20x)

where ![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x%20%3D%20%5Bx_1%2C%20x_2%5D%5ET) and the matrix A change from

![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A_1%20%3D%20%5Cleft%5B%20%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bc%20c%7D1%20%26-100%5C%5C%2010%20%261%20%5Cend%7Barray%7D%0D%0A%5Cright%5D%0D%0A%5Cquad%20%5Ctext%7Bto%7D%20%5Cquad%0D%0AA_2%20%3D%20%5Cleft%5B%20%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bc%20c%7D1%20%2610%5C%5C%20-100%20%261%20%5Cend%7Barray%7D%0D%0A%5Cright%5D)

 when ![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%24x_2%3D2.75%20x_1%24) and switch back  when ![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%24x_2%3D0.365%20x_1%24).

Thus the ODE system alternates the right-hand side when a switching face is encountered. The switching surfaces are given by the algebraic constraints depending on the state variables, as shown below (left)

<img src="ex1.png" width="400"><img src="ex1adj.png" width="400">

* The parameter to which the sensitivities are computed is marked in red.
* It represents the slope of the switching surface.
* Intuitively the trajectory cannot be affected before it hits the surface.
* The influence of the perturbation in the slope diminishes as the trajectory is approaching the equilibrium point.

### Compile the code
This example is in `src/ts/examples/hybrid`. The source code is included in [ex1adj.c](./ex1adj.c)

```
make ex1adj
```

### Make the graghics work via interactive mode on cooley
Graphics is tricky. HPC users often do it offline. In order to make it work with cooley, your computer must have X11 (Mac users can install XQuartz). If you do not have it now, just skip the graphics parts since they are not essential.

Apply for an interactive allocation (skip this if you already got one)
```
$ qsub -I -t 60 -n 1 -A <project_name>
```
For example, if your interactive allocation gives you node cc115, open a new terminal and do the following:
```
$ ssh -C -X -Y cooley.alcf.anl.gov
```
```
$ ssh -X cc115
```
Then continue to run the applications in this new terminal.

### Run 1: Monitor solution graphically with phase diagram

```
./ex1adj -ts_monitor_draw_solution_phase -4,-2,2,2 -draw_pause -2
```

### Run 2: Monitor the timestepping process

```
./ex1adj -ts_monitor
```
Trailing (r) in some lines of the output indicates that a rollback happens. In this example, it is triggered by `TSEvent`. To check  details about the event, we can use the event monitor
```
./ex1adj -ts_monitor -ts_event_monitor
```
We can also monitor the timestepping for the adjoint calculation by doing
```
./ex1adj -ts_monitor -ts_adjoint_monitor
```

### Further information

The example `ex1fwd.c` in the same folder illustrates the forward sensitivity approach for the same problem.


## Example 3: Diffusion-Reaction Problem

This code demonstrates parallel adjoint calculation for a system of time-dependent PDEs on a 2D rectangular grid.
The adjoint solution corresponds to the sensitivities of one component in the final solution w.r.t. the initial conditions.
We will use this example to illustrate the performance considerations for realistic large-scale applications. In particular, we will show how to play with checkpointing and how to profile/tune the performance.

### Compile the code
This example is in `src/ts/examples/advection-diffusion-reaction`. The source code is included in [ex5adj.c](./ex5adj.c)

```
make ex5adj
```

### Run 1: Monitor solution graphically

```
mpiexec -n 4 ./ex5adj -forwardonly -implicitform 0 -ts_type rk \
                     -ts_monitor -ts_monitor_draw_solution
```

* `-forwardonly` perform the forward simulation without doing adjoint
* `-implicitform 0 -ts_type rk` changes the time stepping algorithm to a Runge-Kutta method
* `-ts_monitor_draw_solution` monitors the progress for the solution at each time step
* Add `-draw_pause -2` if you want to pause at the end of simulation to see the plot

### Run 2: Optimal checkpointing schedule
By default, the checkpoints are stored in binary files on disk. Of course, this may not be a good choice for large-scale applications running on high-performance machines where I/O cost is significant. We can make the solver use RAM for checkpointing and specify the maximum allowable checkpoints so that an optimal adjoint checkpointing schedule that minimizes the number of recomputations will be generated.

```
mpiexec -n 4 ./ex5adj -implicitform 0 -ts_type rk -ts_adapt_type none \
                     -ts_max_steps 10 -ts_monitor -ts_adjoint_monitor \
                     -ts_trajectory_type memory -ts_trajectory_max_cps_ram 3 \
                     -ts_trajectory_monitor -ts_trajectory_view
```
The output corresponds to the schedule depicted by the following diagram:

<img src="chkpt.png" width="800">

#### Questions
> **What will happen if we add the option `-ts_trajectory_max_cps_disk 2` to specify there are two available slots for disk checkpoints?**

|<font color="white">Looking at the output, we will find that the new schedule uses both RAM and disk for checkpointing and takes two less recomputations.</font>|

### Run 3: Implicit time integration method
Now we switch to an implicit method ([Crank-Nicolson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crank–Nicolson_method)) using fixed stepsize, which is the default setting in the code. At each time step, a nonlinear system is solved by the PETSc nonlinear solver `SNES`.
```
mpiexec -n 12 ./ex5adj -da_grid_x 1024 -da_grid_y 1024 -ts_max_steps 10 -snes_monitor -log_view -ts_monitor
```
* `-snes_monitor` shows the progress of `SNES`
* `-log_view` prints a summary of the logging

#### Questions
> **Where is the majority of CPU time spent?**

|<font color="white">Of course answer may vary depending on the settings such as number of procs, problem size, and solver options. Typically most of the time should be spent on [VecMDot](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-current/docs/manualpages/Vec/VecMDot.html) or [MatMult](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-current/docs/manualpages/Mat/MatMult.html) </font>|

> **How expensive is it to do an adjoint step?**

|<font color="white">For this particular run, an adjoint step takes about 60-70% of the running time of a forward step (compare the time between TSAdjointStep and TSStep). </font>|

> **How can we improve performance?**

|<font color="white">1. Use memory instead of disk for checkpointing(`-ts_trajectory_type memory -ts_trajectory_solution_only 0`); 2. Tune the time stepping solver, nonlinear solver, linear solver, preconditioner and so forth. </font>|

### Further information
Because this example uses `DMDA`, Jacobian can be efficiently approxiated using finite difference with coloring. You can use the option `-snes_fd_color` to enable this feature.

## Out-Brief

We have used [PETSc](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) to demonstrate the adjoint capability as an enabling technology for dynamic-constrained optimization. In particular, we focused on time-depdent problems including complex dynamical systems with discontinuities and a large scale hyperbolic PDE.

We have shown the basic usage of the adjoint solver as well as functionalities that can facilitate rapid development, diagnosis and performance profiling.
